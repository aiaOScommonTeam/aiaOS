                    <h2>What is aiaOS?</h2>
                    aiaOS is an terminal-based OS simulator that was made 4 fun. <br>
                    aiaOS for now is in the prealpha development stage.
                    <h2>What platform is it for?</h2>
                    At the moment it's only available on Android and I don't think it'll be available on any other platform.
                    <h2>When will be the full release?</h2>
                    Honestly, I don't know.
                    <h2>aiaOS download link</h2>
